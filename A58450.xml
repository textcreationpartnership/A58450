            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>His Majesty was not a little concerned at this proceeding (It being so far from the former course of that House to do any thing against the Kings Inclination.)

                     <p>His Majesty hath received an Address from you which he hath seriously considered of, and returneth you this Answer, That he is much troubled, that that Declaration which he put out for ends so necessary to the quiet of the Kingdom; and especially in that Conjuncture, should have proved the cause of disquiet in the House of Commons, and have given occasion to question his power in <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> which he finds not done in the Reigns of any of his Ancestors. And he is sure he never had thoughts of using it otherwise then as it has been entrusted in him to the Peace and Establishment of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to the ease of all his Subjects in general; Neither doth he pretend to the right of suspending any Laws, wherein the properties, Rights, or Liberties of his Subjects are concerned; nor to alter any thing in the Established, Doctrine or Discipline of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The onely design of this was to take off the penalties the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes inflict upon Dissenters, and which he believes when well considered of you, your selves would not wish executed according to the Rigour and Letter of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Neither hath he done this with thought of avoiding or preclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Advice of his Parliament. And if any Bill shall be offer'd him which shall appear more proper to attain the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said

                     <p>The thanks of the House was returned to his Majesty for his Gracious assurances and promises, but the Answer being not as they thought satisfactory; his Majesty seeming to justifie his proceeding in that affair, they resolved to make a Reply thereunto, and thereby secure both Law and property.</p>
                     <p>Which endured some Debate, wherein was related a passage in a Speech of his Majesties, of <hi>February,</hi> 18th. <hi>1662.</hi> to both Houses of Parliament (when other Councells were prevalent with his Majesty) whereby he wisheth that he had such pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in matters <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> as he claimes to give by this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration; which passage is as followeth:</p>

                  <hi>March,</hi> 1. 1672. His Majesty made this following Speech to the House of Lords.</head>
               <q>
                  <p>My Lords, You know that at the Opening of this Session, I spoke here to your satisfaction, it hath notwithstanding gotten a greater Disquiet in the House of Commons, then I could Imagine. I have received an Address from them, which I looked not for, and made them an Answer which ought to have contented them: But on the contrary, they have made such a Reply of such a Nature, that I cannot think fit to proceed any further in this Matter, without your Advice.</p>
                  <p>I have Commanded my Lord Chancellor to Acquaint you with all the Transactions, wherein you will find Me and your selves highly concerned. I am sensible of what Relates to my Self: And I assure you, my Lords, I am not less for your Priviledg, and the Honour of this House.</p>
               </q>
               <p>By this means, the Lords (that medled not before) became as it were Interessed in the Matter above Recited. And took the Kings Application unto them for their Advice, as such an extraordinary Favour, that the same day they shewed their Gratitude, by present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him their humble Thanks, in these words: <hi>We the Lords <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>al in Parliament Assembled, do unanimously present your Sacred Majesty our most humble Thanks, for having been pleased to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto us, what hath passed between your Majesty and the House of Commons; whereby your Majesty hath Graciously offered the Means of shewing our Duty to your Majesty, and of Asserting the Antient Just Rights and Priviledges, of the House of Peers.</hi> Whereunto the King returned this Answer:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My Lords, I take this Address of yours very kindly, and will always be Affectionate to you, and I expect that you shall Stand by me, as I will always by you.</q> Yet notwithstanding these sweet words, it was the next day only Resolved: That the Kings Answer to the House of Commons, in referring the Points now Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to a Parliamentary Way by Bill, is Good and Gracious, that being a Good and Natural Course for Satisfaction therein. This Vote seemed to them the fittest Means to Reconcile the Matters Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43772:5"/> it neither determining one way or other, as to the rig of the matter in Debate; And yet for all this, the Commons receded not from their first purpose of setling the power claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King on it's old Foundation, as you shall see here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, whil'st this was in agitation in the House of Lords, the Commons taking notice of the extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Popery and prevalency of that Faction at Court; who had so powerfully managed their Interest as to procure ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And the Most <hi>Christian King,</hi> coming into the Field with a powerful Army not only to defend what he had gotten the last year, but to Conquer the Residue: And besides this, two Royal Fleets pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared (the one by his Majesty, the other by the <hi>French King</hi>) to Attack them by Sea and Land, as opportunity should serve; made many people imagine the <hi>Dutch</hi> upon their last Legs, and consequently this Nation in a tottering Condition, both as to Religion and property; so that an absolute necessity oblieged the Commons to shew then (if ever) what they could do, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the removal thereof- And therefore <hi>March</hi> the 3d. agreed to an Address, to be presented to his Majesty for Suppression of Popery; whereunto the Lords Concurrence was desired, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Conference obtained, the Address was presented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in the Banquetting House, <hi>March</hi> the 7th. which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

But the seeming delay it hath met with since, has made them take new Courage: And they are now preparing for the next Summer a greater Fleet, as they say, then ever they had yet.

                     <p>That he observed the Addresses consisted of several different parts, and therefore it could not be expected there should be a present Answer, but for the several parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things contained in them, he would before the next meeting, take such effectual care that no man should have Reason to Complain.</p>

               <p>With which the House thought themselves and the Nation so well secured, that the next day they Voted their humble Thanks to be presented unto his Majesty, for his Gracious Answers to their several Addresses, and in particular, for his last Gracious Message; and for the care he hath declared he would take of the Protestant Religion: And so the Money Bill, and the Bill for the Suppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Growth of popery, were willingly passed, and obtained the Royal Assent at the same time; and thereupon the parliament was Adjourned, till the 20th. <hi>of October,</hi> following.</p>
               <p>This last Act, with his Majesties Gracious assurances before related; were esteemed by some a sufficient defence to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, and the Liberties and properties of the Subject.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all these seeming probabilities of assurance, the <hi>Clifforaian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Designs, were carried on in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal of this Session, in as pernicious though different manner from their first De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ign, whose Method they were forced to change, by reason that the Act of parliament for the Suppression of the Growth of popery, was so made that it executed it self; and the means of introducing that Religion seeming then at a stand, they thought of a new project, that in probability might not receive so great opposition nor attract that envy as the preferment of the papists in several great Offices and places of Trust had done, yet the same ends might be more certainly and easily though possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not so soon obtained. And to this end, a Marriage between his Royal Highness, and the princess of <hi>Modena,</hi> Sister to the present Duke thereof, was proposed; and the better to advance the same, and make the Match appear more considerable; his Most <hi>Christian Majesty</hi> had declared her an Adopted Daughter of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43772:11"/>
                  <hi>France,</hi> and would give her a potion suitable thereunto; which Match was concluded without any great difficulty, by the Earle of <hi>Peterborough;</hi> and afterward Consumated by the same person, by his Majesties Royal Consent and Authority; according to the Form used among princes (as his Majesty was pleased to express it.)</p>
               <p>Hereupon the <hi>popish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> party were grown extreamly insolent, having in most mens Judgments received a less check from the late Act of Parliament, then incouragement from the Marriage.</p>
               <p>But before her Highness could arrive in <hi>England,</hi> the Advisers of this Marriage perceived that the twentieth of <hi>October</hi> would come, and that it might probably receive some Obstructions from the Parliament, and that some other things contrived at their meeting in <hi>March</hi> before, to their prejudice; might chance in a short time to be perfected: and therefore ordered it so that the parliament should be prorogued till the 27th of the same <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> whereby an end should be put to that Session, and all the business then unperfected fall to the Ground, contrary to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Gracious Assurances, and promises, in <hi>March</hi> last, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing these Consequences as certain First, Thereby to prevent and remove from his Majesty all Temptations to break the intended Marriage, and the <hi>French</hi> Alliance, knowing that the Parliament would use their utmost endeavours, to prevent the Consumation of that marriage; which was likely to render both the popish Religion and the <hi>French</hi> Alliance Impregnable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Considering that a Bill of Ease for protestant Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (whereby 'twas intended that the major part of them should have Liberty of Conscience, and be capable of Church prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) had passed the House of Commons, and had been sent up to the Lords in <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But if they could by any means whatsoever prevent the passing of that Bill, they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, notwithstanding all the Parliament could do, to be safe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43772:11"/> amongst so many <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and drive on their Designs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, for the Ruine and Destruction of all parties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Jealousie between the King and Parliament, whereby (if all other Devices fail) they hope by the help of <hi>French</hi> Forces to Introduce Popery into this Nation, and with it Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which last they have by all Arts imaginable cried up as the best Government; but at the same time deny it to be practicable here, unless Popery precedes, or comes in with it. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>This was not so closely carried but the Parliament had notice thereof, and the House of Commons hoping to prevent the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that might arise from this Match, Voted <hi>October</hi> the 20th. (before they were Prorogued) That the privy Councellors of the House should present an Address to his Majesty, whereby he should be desired to put an Effectual stop to the Consummation thereof; which was done accordingly, though not to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as it was hoped, as I shall presently shew.</p>

               <p>This Speech being ended, and the House of Commons Assembled in their own House, the consideration thereof (such vast Sums of Money being thereby demanded, as the Nation was unable, and the House thought not safe to give) was Adjourned till <hi>Friday,</hi> and the House Adjourned till <hi>Thursday</hi> following; at which time the House being met, Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> brought the Answer ensuing, to the Address against the Match.</p>

                     <p>That his Majesty having received an Address from the House of Commons, presenting their humble desire that the intended Marriage between his Royal Highness and the Princess of <hi>Modena</hi> may not be Consummated, commanded this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to be returned. That he perceived the House of Commons wanted a full Information of this Matter, the Match being not barely Intended, but Compleated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Form used amongst Princes, by his Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Authority. Nor could he in the least suppose it to be disagreeable in the House of Commons, his Royal Highness having been in View of the World for several
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43772:12"/> Months ingaged in Treaty of Marrying with another Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Princess, and yet a Parliament held during that time, and not the least Exception taken of it.</p>

               <p>With this Answer the House were not satisfied, and were resolved not to give over the Defence of our Religion and Liberty at such an easie Rate, esteeming this Frenchified Match of far greater danger then the proposed Marriage with the Dutchess of <hi>In pruck,</hi> hinted in the Answer, was at that time of the Treaty thereof, if it should have taken effect; for then the Religion of his Royal Highness was unknown to most of the Nation, he having since that time refused the Tests provided in the late Act of Parliament for surpressing of Popery: And besides the House of <hi>Austria</hi> (whereof she was) did not then appear to be in a capacity to assist so powerfully the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that Religion, as the <hi>French</hi> at this time did: And therefore the House Voted another Address with Reasons against the Marriage, and the same day Voted, That a Bill should be prepared for a General Test betwixt Protestants and Papists, and that those that Refused to take it should be uncapable of bearing any Office Millitary or Civil, or to Sit in Parliament, or come within five Miles of the Court. By this Vote the chief Designs of the <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> party were intended to be disappointed; but they ordered their Affairs so that they soon Evaded it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday▪ October</hi> 31. the House in a Grand Committee, upon as serious Debate as ever was known there before, took into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration his Majesties Speech, and resolved,
<q>That the House considering the present condition of the Nation, will not take into any further Debate, or Consideration, any Aid, or Supply, or Charge upon the Subject, before the time of payment of the <hi>18</hi> Months Assessment granted by a late Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Intituled, <hi>An Act for Raising the Sum of 1238750</hi> l. for Supply of his Majesties present Ocasions be expired, unless it shall appear that the Obstinacy of the <hi>Dutch</hi> shall render it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: Nor before this Kingdom be effectually Secured from the Danger of Popery and Popish Counsels, and Counsellors, and the other present Grievances be Redressed.</q>

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:43772:13"/>
               <p>This last Vote nettled the Court not a little (which only stands in need of Parliaments to raise Money) and therefore were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give them one Remove more, but that it might not seem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon the Account of denying Money, they let the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceed: Who on <hi>Monday</hi> then following, attended his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty with the second Address, with Reasons against the Marriage (they being at that time assured that it was not so far concluded, but that for Reason of State it might have been Rejected, as it hath been practised in several Nations, and even by the <hi>French</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in several Examples, (as do manifestly appear in the <hi>French</hi> Lustories) And to the end the Reader may take notice thereof, I have here inserted it.</p>

                     <p>We your Majesties most Humble and Loyal Subjects, the Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, being full of Assurance of your Majesties Gracious Intentions to provide for the Establishment of Religion, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of your People in Peace and Security; and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the dangerous Cosequences which may follow the Marriage of his Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> with the Princess of <hi>Modena,</hi> or any other of the Popish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Do hold our selves bound in Conscience and Duty to Represent the same to your Sacred Majesty, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but those constant Testimonies which we have given your Majesty, of our True and Loyal Affections to your Sacred Person, will easily gain a Belief that these our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Desires proceed from Hearts still full of the same Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection toward your Sacred Majesty, and with Intentions to Establish your Royal Government upon those true Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the Protestant Religion; and the Hearts of your People with all Humility desiring your Majesty to take the same into your Princely Consideration, and to Relieve your Subjects from those Fears and Apprehensions which at present they Lie under, from the progress hath been made in that Treaty.</p>
                     <p>We do therefore humbly Beseech your Majesty to Consider, that if this Marriage do proceed, it will be a means to Disquiet the Minds of your Protestant Subjects at Home,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43772:13"/> and to fill them with endless Jealousies and Discontents and will bring your Majesty into such Alliances abroad, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And we find by sad Experience, that such Marriages have Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and Encouraged <hi>Popery</hi> in this Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And we do already observe, how much that party is Animated with the hopes of th s Match, who were lately Discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by your Majesties Gracious Concess ons, in the last meeting of this Parliament.</p>
                     <p>That we greatly fear this may be an occasion to lessen the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the People to his Royal Highness, who is so nearly Related to the Crown, and whose Honour and Esteem we desire always be intirely preserved.</p>
                     <p>That for another Age more at least, this Kingdom will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the continual Apprehensions of the Growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the Danger of the Protestant Religion.</p>
                     <p>Lastly we consider that this Princess having so near a Relation, and Kindred to many eminent persons of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> may give them great opportunities to promote their Designs, and carry on their practices amongst us; and by the same means penetrate into your Majesties most secret Counsels, and more easily discover the state of the whole Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And finding that by the Opinions of very Learned Men, it is generally Admitted, that such Treaties and Contracts by Proxie are dissolvable, of which there are several Instances to be produced: We do in all Humbleness beseech your Majesty to put a stop to the Consummation of this intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Marriage.</p>
                     <p>And this we do the more Importunately desire, because we have not as yet the happiness to see any Issue of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty that may Succeed in the Government of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; which Blessing we most heartily pray Almighty God in His due time to Bestow upon your Majesty and
